        <h2>WHAT IS THE CLEARING PURPOSE FRAMEWORK?</h2>
        <p>It is a process to structure thoughts with a clear purpose.</p>
        <p>Ideas may come from many places, but a clear idea, or a vision, must come from a clear purpose. Thus, the main source of energy for a project of change is not an idea, it is the intention of its leader.
        </p>
        <p>This is the heart of the CLEARING PURPOSE FRAMEWORK .</p>
        <p class="dark-text">It is a process that helps leaders, entrepreneurs and changemakers to structure thoughts, develop vision and generate impact with a clear purpose.
        </p>
        <p>It generates the visualization of significant solutions for change, in a quick process to test and share a
            vision.</p>
        <p>It is also very useful for leadership teams that need to bring alignment of visions, act for change and for a greater impact.</p>
        <p class="dark-text">The skills developed in the process can be applied in a variety of ways, such as a sprint - a process of rapid prototyping a vision to optimize decision making - or the 2 week 4-level leadership program to visualize results and gain a final vision.
        </p>
        <p>To gain clarity, four levels of development structure the framework process: purpose, vision, meaning and impact.

            </h2>
            <p>Our purpose is a reason already determined by our nature. It is a matter of clearing, rather than
                finding.</p>
            <p>A clear purpose is the visualization of what you can bring as an impact to a context. It is born when you connect to the will to serve your community, the society, or the world. That is why the framework process 
begins with exercises to elevate context perception.
            </p>
            <p class="some-text"><span>Purpose</span> Focus on context, perception and appreciation. A situation seen from an elevated state of perception generates appreciation and inspires meaningful thoughts and connections with our will to serve.</p>
            <p>Appreciation is the key to a clearer perception. It is a natural ability to recognize, understand and raise the totalvalue of something, someone or a situation. It avoids a one-sided perspective. A consequence of appreciation is the connection with the will to contribute, as it moves our perception and leads us to compassion.
            </p>
            <p>The framework uses reflection questions and exercises to activate appreciation and clear the purpose.</p>

                VISION
            </h2>
            <p>The framework finds in the intention to serve, or, a clear purpose, the main source of energy for a project of change. This is the foundation for developing a vision.
            </p>
            <p>A clear vision creates exceptional solutions, because appreciative perception allows you to clearly see how to reorganize resources to develop potentials and generate change.
            </p>
            <p class="some-text"><span>Vision</span> - Focus on resources and potential for a greater good. When you can see new ways to reorganize resources to make potentials develop and situations change, your thoughts have come to meaningful solutions.
            </p>
            <p>The framework reconfigures the way we look at resources and potentials in a situation, even in a state of crisis.The change in perspective brings new angles that activate the perception of prosperity, even a crisis situation can improve in relation to the previous state of crisis.

                MEANING
            </h2>
            <p>Full understanding of the vision happens only when it is put to test. A test is a minimal viable action in which the leader presents the solution so the vision can be shared and potentially be recognized by the community.
            </p>
            <p>At this level, the potential for integrating resources is enhanced, because a truly shared vision brings results that benefit all involved.

            </p>
            <p class="some-text"><span>Meaning</span> - Focus on tests and shared values. Testing for inclusion allows allinvolved to share the vision and to integrate values to benefit all.</p>
            <p>Sharing a vision, even in an early stage version, can influence the perception of the whole situation as it reveals new possibilities, previously unnoticeable, therefore allowing new possible destinies for the context.

                IMPACT
            </h2>
            <p>Now, the leader does not walk alone in this change endeavor. The final vision is the result of the shared vision.</p>
            <p>At this point, it is possible to consider that the future of the context already reveals another potential result. Thisallows everyone involved to be guided by a vision that catalyzes change and benefits all.
            </p>
            <p class="some-text"><span>Impact</span> - Impact - Focus on designing the final vision. Unified vision and values allows the final visualization of the impact of an implementation.
            </p>
            <p>The CLEARING PURPOSE FRAMEWORK is a process that acts as a vortex of vision. If one reaches the state of clear purpose,
                one achieves the intention of unity and shares an abundant vision of reconfiguring resources to benefit all.
