                    <p>It is not recommended. The CLEARING PURPOSE FRAMEWORK applies to a situation of interest, in
                        the context where you want to undertake a solution. Therefore, it is more effective to focus on a
                        particular situation.</p>

                        a project, and this is something that is considered in its development.</p>

                    <p>The responses developed come from the user's knowledge. They will be validated with the interested parties, on a case-by-case basis, and under the user's responsibility.

                    </p>

                    <p>The Framework guides thinking within 4 steps. 1- Purpose (context perception and intention with a clear purpose), 2- Vision (how to organize potentials and resources to generate a change) and two final steps that do not have the function of generate validation: 3- Meaning (test and vision sharing) and 4- Impact (application and full understanding of the final vision). These steps make it possible to structure thinking through practical learning, which increases the accuracy of a solution and the effectiveness of project management.

                    <p>The goal of Level 3 - Meaning is to develop the understanding for the clear communication of your project. Levels 1 and 2 (Purpose and Vision) also help, but it is the validation that will make the vision's meaning clearer. Once communication becomes clearer and more effective, the potential for engagement is greater. However, it will only occur effectively if people share the values that the vision of the project brings.

                        A clear purpose is to visualize what someone can impact and contribute to a context. A clear purpose transcends the organization's purpose, because it does not depend on it to be exercised. It shares the same values, unifies purposes, brings alignment and is directly related to the potential results of this partnership.
